        "The Mandalorians are a clan-based cultural group that was composed of members from multiple
        species all bound by a common culture, creed, and code. They originated on the planet
        Mandalore in the galaxy's Outer Rim Territories and had a particularly important role in
        galactic history as legendary warriors against the Jedi."
